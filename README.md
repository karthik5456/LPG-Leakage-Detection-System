# LPG-Leakage-Detection-System
"LPG Leakage Detection and Alert System using IoT technology. This system continuously monitors LPG levels using a gas sensor, and triggers an alert if a leakage is detected, sending notifications to an IoT platform (ThingSpeak or Blynk). The project is implemented using Python for data processing and communication with the IoT cloud."
